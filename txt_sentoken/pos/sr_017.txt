Dhaka Wasa has set up a number of ATM booths that dispense drinking water at a cost of Tk0.4 per litre.

There are about 100 such booths across the capital in areas including: Fakirapool, Basabo, Mugda, Banasree, Matuail, and Rampura. Dhaka Wasa has developed this to supply pure water – with the financial assistance of US-based Drinkwell.
