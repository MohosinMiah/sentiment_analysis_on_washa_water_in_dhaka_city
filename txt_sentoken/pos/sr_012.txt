I love the fact that WASA has decided to protest police brutality in the United States by pumping black water in the East Rampura area. Although I am an avid believer in the #BlackLivesMatter campaign but your method of protesting is forcing us to purchase water even though I have to admit taking shower with drinking water was fun but after a week I feel indifferent to it, also it does not make sense financially. Can you please find some other way of protesting ? try taking the knee like NFL players perhaps.
